# GraphRAG (Go) - WIP

A minimalist Go implementation of Microsoft's GraphRAG using Go. The initial focus is on the query interface itself that works with the output from the [Python implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag) to allow for easy integration with existing Go projects, and simplifying deployment.
